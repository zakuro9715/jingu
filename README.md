# Why Jingu

I went to Jingu(Grand Shrine in Ise) in the day on that this project began.

Jingu worship two goddesses, Amaterasu-Omikami and Toyouke-Omikami.
Amaterasu-Omikami is goddess of sun and progenitor of Tenno(Emperor of Japan) and all Japanese.
Toyouke-Omikami is goddess of agriculture and industry.

I trust that I made this compiler with power of two goddesses 

so, I name jingu this project in gratitude.
